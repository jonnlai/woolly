### Colour Scheme

Colours that evoke warmth, comfort, and natural beauty i.e earthy colours ad soft neutrals that suggest coziness and handmade craftsmanship were used across this site.

White Smoke (#F7F6F3) is used for light background areas to keep the site feeling fresh and airy. Soft Wool Cream (#F5F2E1) which is a warm, off-white color reminiscent of natural wool, was used for all the buttons. Hearty Clay (#D9A37E) was used for links to bring a rustic, cozy feel that is grounded and earthy. Autumn Maple (#C56F3A) was used mainly for hover effects. Its deep, warm orange-brown colour resembles autumn leaves or rich caramel, and evokes a sense of warmth. Deep Charcoal (#3C3C3C) was used for text.

Red was used for the 'delete' buttons to highlight the danger to avoid hikes being deleted accidently.
