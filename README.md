### Product reviews

All site users can see reviews and rating that the product has been given but only registered users who have bought the product can leave a review or rate the product. The product rating displayed under the product name is the avarage of all user ratings for that particular product. The rating updates automatically when a new review is left.

| Review form                                                   |  Review left                                              |
| ---                                                           | ---                                                       |
| ![review form](assets/readme-files/features/review-form.png)  | ![review left](assets/readme-files/features/reviews.png)  | 

| Not logged in                                                             | Not bought                                                                    |
| ---                                                                       | ---                                                                           |
| ![not logged in](assets/readme-files/features/review-not-loggedin.png)    | ![product not bought](assets/readme-files/features/reviews-not-bought.png)    |

### Connect Django to AWS Bucket

1. Install two new packages: boto3 and django-storages. Freeze them into requirements.txt.   
   ```
   pip3 install boto3
   pip3 install django-storages 
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt  
   ```

2. Add storages to the Installed Apps in settings.py.

3. In settings.py, we need to set cache control, set bucket configurations, set static and media files location, and override static and media URLs in production. We'll only want to do this on Heroku, so add an if statement as well.
   ```
   if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
      # Cache control
      AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
         'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
         'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
      }

      # Bucket Config
      AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
      AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_REGION'
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
      AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

      # Static and media files
      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
      STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
      DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
      MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media' 

      # Override static and media URLs in production
      STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
      MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
   ```

   If you have not done so yet, set the Config Vars on Heroku. On your app's dashboard on Heroku, go to Settings and click Reveal Convig Vars. Add the following variables:

   1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your access key id from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your secret access key from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   3. USE_AWS | True    

   Also remove the COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars.   

4. We then want to tell Django that in production we want to use S3 to store our static files whenever collectstatic is run, and that we sent any uploaded images to go there as well. Create a custom_storages.py file in your project's root directory, and inside it, include the Static and Media Storage locations: 
   ```
   from django.conf import settings
   from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage
 

   class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


   class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
   ```  

5. Finally, push these changes on Github.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```

### Deployment on Heroku

1. Create a new Heroku app:
    * Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    * Choose a name for the app and select the location.

2. Update the code for deployment:
    * Use pip3 to install gunicorn~=20.1
    * Freeze gunicorn to requirements.txt
    * Using gunicorn and woolly wsgi file, add a command in the Procfile to start the webserver.
    * Append '.herokuapp.com' to ALLOWED_HOSTS list.
    * Ensure that DEBUG has been set to 'False' in settings.py file.

3. Deploy to Heroku:
    * Go to the 'Setting' tab and reveal 'Config vars'
    * Add the following Config vars:
        1. 'DATABASE_URL'
        2. 'SECRET_KEY'
        3. 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
        4. 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
        5. 'EMAIL_HOST_PASS'
        6. 'EMAIL_HOST_USER'
        7. 'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY'
        8. 'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'
        9. 'STRIPE_WH_SECRET'
        10. 'USE_AWS' (set to True)

## Fixed Bugs

* When adjusting the quantity of a product in the bag template, the amount requested was added to the existing amount instead of the amount being updated to the new value. This was fixed by changing the `bag[item_id] += quantity` to `bag[item_id] = quantity` in the adjust_bag view.

* Sale price can be left blank when the product has been marked as being on sale. This caused an issue with the `product_price` function due the sale price being set to `NoneType`. The sale price displayed to the user was also 'None'. This was fixed by adjusting the product templates and `product_price` function to check that a sale price has been set for any products marked as 'on sale', and if no sale price has been set, the normal price is being displayed.

* The bottom part of the Account dropdown menu in the navigation bar was hidden behind the jumbotron. This meant that admin users were not able to access the Admin Dashboard dropdown option easily on all screen sizes. This was fixed by setting the dropdown's position to 'fixed' and increasing its and its parent element's z-index to ensure that it shown above the jumbotron at all times.

* Clicking the brand logo link was not working on smaller devices due to the brand logo element being positioned behind other elements on small screens. This was fixed by reducing the width of the brand logo link div and increasing its z-index.

* Adding the jumbotron image caused a horizontal scrollbar to appear on the Home page and that caused usability issues. This was fixed by adding `overflow-x: hidden` to the main element.

* The review form was continued to displayed on the product detail page until the page was reloaded after the user had submitted their review which resulted in some reviews being submitted twice. This was fixed by adding `return redirect('product_detail', product_id)` after a successful POST request in the product_detail view.

* The newsletter confirmation emails were not going through to the email address provided. This was due to `recipient_email` having been put in quotation marks in `send_mail`.
