## Code Validation

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) were used to validate the HTML, CSS and JS code to ensure that the project meets the current Web Standards and is free from any unintended syntax errors and mistakes that could cause issues with accessibility and usability. [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) were used to validate the Python code.

### HTML

* W3C Markup Validator highlighted the following errors that were corrected.

| Error                                                                 | Action taken                           |
| ---                                                                   | ---                                    |
| ![&nbsp error](assets/readme-files/testing/html-error-nbsp.png)       | The missing semicolon was added        |
| ![unclosed div](assets/readme-files/testing/profile-unclosed-div.png) | The missing div was added              |
| ![table rows](assets/readme-files/testing/dashboard-tr.png)           | This missing table rows were added     |
| ![strong element](assets/readme-files/testing/strong-element.png)     | The strong element was removed         |
| ![Duplicate ID](assets/readme-files/testing/checkout-email-error.png) | The issue was caused by having two crispy forms on the same page. The duplicate ids were created by crispy forms. The issue was solved by not using crispy to render the newsletter form which only consisted of an email input field. |
| ![JS Type attribute](assets/readme-files/testing/html-js-type-attr.png)| This was left unresolved as it is a warning rather than an error and the code comes from the CI boutique ago walkthrough project |

### CSS

All CSS files was validated using [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No error were found.

![CSS validator](assets/readme-files/testing/css-main.png)

### Python

[autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) were used throghout development to validate the Python code for PEP8 requirements.

Several whitespace and indentation errors as well as errors regarding unused imports were identified and these were rectified where possible.

* Some issues highlighted by Flake8, some of which are shown below, were ignored as they related to migration files, settings, .env and .vscode files only. The developer is currently studying how to ignore those files when using Flake8 to validate code.
* As the developer was new to using Flake8, all the Python code was also validated using CI Python Linter to ensure PEP8 compliance. No errors were found, an example of below.

![Flake8](assets/readme-files/testing/flake8.png)
![CI Python Linter](assets/readme-files/testing/ci-python-linter.png)

### Javascript

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) warned about missing semicolons, these were added. Two undefined variables 'size' were also noted. These removed as they were unnecessary.

![JSHint size](assets/readme-files/testing/jshint-size.png)

JSHint also highlighted variables that it considered undefined. These variables (Stripe, bootstrap) from head element of the base.html file and therefore these were ignored.

## Performance and Accessibility

Chrome DevTool Lighthouse was used to assess the project's performance and accessibility. The reports confirmed that the page performs well and is accessible. The recommendations relating to Best Practice noted that, because of AWS and Stripe, the site is using third party cookies, which lowers the Best Practices score. Some of the recommendation to improve Performace relate to AWS and Stripe and render-blocking resources.
