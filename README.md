### User Stories

An Excel spreadsheet was used to collect Epics and User Stories before development was started. Six Epics were identified to help to organise the work: 1. User Profiles, 2. Products, 3. Bag and 4. Checkout 5.Marketing 6. Comments and Ratings. These Epics were broken down into user stories with clearly defined Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, Story Points and MoSCoW prioritisation.

Before development was started the User Stories were transferred to GitHub projects that was used as a Kanban board to track user stories and the progress made.

### Colour Scheme

Colours that evoke warmth, comfort, and natural beauty i.e earthy colours ad soft neutrals that suggest coziness and handmade craftsmanship were used across this site.

White Smoke (#F7F6F3) is used for light background areas to keep the site feeling fresh and airy. Soft Wool Cream (#F5F2E1) which is a warm, off-white color reminiscent of natural wool, was used for all the buttons. Hearty Clay (#D9A37E) was used for links to bring a rustic, cozy feel that is grounded and earthy. Autumn Maple (#C56F3A) was used mainly for hover effects. Its deep, warm orange-brown colour resembles autumn leaves or rich caramel, and evokes a sense of warmth. Deep Charcoal (#3C3C3C) was used for text.

Red was used for the 'delete' buttons to highlight the danger to avoid hikes being deleted accidently.
