## User Experience

### Project goals

* The website creates a sense of trust-worthiness and high-quality.
* The website is responsive and can easily be used on different devices.
* The style and structure of the website is consistent and intuitive to allow user to navigate the website easily.
* Users are able to create a profile to store their shipping information and view information about their past orders.
* The shop owner is able to update and remove content from the page easily.

### User Stories

An Excel spreadsheet was used to collect Epics and User Stories before development was started. Six Epics were identified to help to organise the work: 1. User Profiles, 2. Products, 3. Bag and 4. Checkout 5.Marketing 6. Comments and Ratings. These Epics were broken down into user stories with clearly defined Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, Story Points and MoSCoW prioritisation.

![User Stories - Profiles, Marketing, Ratings](assets/readme-files/user-stories/user-stories-profile-marketing-ratings.png)

Before development was started the User Stories were transferred to GitHub projects that was used as a Kanban board to track user stories and the progress made.

### Database Model

The database model was designed using [Lucid](https://lucid.app/). PostgreSQL object-relational database management system was used.

### Colour Scheme

Colours that evoke warmth, comfort, and natural beauty i.e earthy colours ad soft neutrals that suggest coziness and handmade craftsmanship were used across this site.

White Smoke (#F7F6F3) is used for light background areas to keep the site feeling fresh and airy. Soft Wool Cream (#F5F2E1) which is a warm, off-white color reminiscent of natural wool, was used for all the buttons. Hearty Clay (#D9A37E) was used for links to bring a rustic, cozy feel that is grounded and earthy. Autumn Maple (#C56F3A) was used mainly for hover effects. Its deep, warm orange-brown colour resembles autumn leaves or rich caramel, and evokes a sense of warmth. Deep Charcoal (#3C3C3C) was used for text.

Red was used for the 'delete' buttons to highlight the danger to avoid hikes being deleted accidently.

![Colour palette](assets/readme-files/woolly-colours.png)

### Typography

Merriweather was used for the headings due to its readability and warm, and approachable feel with its rounded serifs. Poppins was used for the body due give the site a bit of modern sophistication while remaining easy to read. Its slightly rounded structure gives it a soft, friendly feel.

## Marketing

### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

Keywork reseach was carried out using tools such as [Google search](https://www.google.com/) and [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/) to identify the most relevant keywords for this e-commerce business. These keywords were then added in the header element't meta tags.

As a result of the research conducted, the following short-tail and long-tail keywords were selected:

* sustainable wool products
* ethical clothing
* high-quality Nordic design
* Nordic wool blanket
* minimalist wool blanket
* warm woollen clothing
* Nordic wool
* handmade wool clothing

The effectiveness of these keywords would be monitored using tools such as Google Analytics. Based on the results, the keywords would be adjusted to reflect on what keywords have resulted in most traffic to the site.

### Business Model

### Connect Django to AWS Bucket

1. Install two new packages: boto3 and django-storages. Freeze them into requirements.txt.   
   ```
   pip3 install boto3
   pip3 install django-storages 
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt  
   ```

2. Add storages to the Installed Apps in settings.py.

3. In settings.py, we need to set cache control, set bucket configurations, set static and media files location, and override static and media URLs in production. We'll only want to do this on Heroku, so add an if statement as well.
   ```
   if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
      # Cache control
      AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
         'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
         'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
      }

      # Bucket Config
      AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
      AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_REGION'
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
      AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

      # Static and media files
      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
      STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
      DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
      MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media' 

      # Override static and media URLs in production
      STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
      MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
   ```

   If you have not done so yet, set the Config Vars on Heroku. On your app's dashboard on Heroku, go to Settings and click Reveal Convig Vars. Add the following variables:

   1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your access key id from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your secret access key from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   3. USE_AWS | True    

   Also remove the COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars.   

4. We then want to tell Django that in production we want to use S3 to store our static files whenever someone runs collectstatic, and that we sent any uploaded images to go there as well. Create a custom_storages.py file in your project's root directory, and inside it, include the Static and Media Storage locations: 
   ```
   from django.conf import settings
   from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage
 

   class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


   class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
   ```  

5. Finally, push these changes on Github.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```
